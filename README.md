My personal site website written in Next.js using TypeScript.

## Project Structure

All website sections are different components inside `components/`. This components are being used in `app/page.tsx`.

`components/Header.tsx` use `hooks/theme.ts` for changing theme.

For getting discord data I use [Lanyard API](https://github.com/Phineas/lanyard) (`data/discord.ts`).

Some components require data from `data/index.ts`. All data types inside `data/types.ts`.
